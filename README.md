Multitool is a program designed to be easy to use while maintaining some powerful tools. Some tools are made to be very quick and simple while others can be used easily while power-users can appreciate the depth of the program. Even then, it is designed to be "hackable" so more users can benefit from this program when using it for their own needs.

To use this program, the user must install these in Terminal (Mac):

 - pip install requests
 - pip install lxml

Safety:
 - The login credentials are encrypted so that one password (ie: password) can have 10000 forms, therefore making it very difficult to crack. So do not worry about your passwords stored in this program.
